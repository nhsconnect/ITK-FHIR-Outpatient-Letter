## Introduction ##

The Transfer Of Care Outpatient Letter  Specification supports the following care communications:

**Outpatient Letter Document** – An ITK3 FHIR Document containing Transfer of Care information between the hospital clinic and the GP and other relevant parties following a consultation in a clinic.
   
FHIR Messaging components specified within this site have been developed by NHS Digital and use some of the CareConnect profiles created in collaboration with the INTEROPen community. 

The INTEROPen vision is to create a library of nationally defined HL7® FHIR® resources and interaction patterns that implementers can adopt to simplify integration and interoperability within UK health and social care.

Find out more on the [INTEROPen website](http://interopen.org/).

This documentation provides a FHIR document implementation of the work done by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AoMRC) in defining headings for clinical documents.
