## Allergies and Adverse Reactions Section Content##
The Allergies and adverse reactions section carries information about the patient's allergies and adverse reactions. Elements should be formatted as subheadings in any HTML sent.

## How to Represent "No Known Allergies" ## 
When there is a positive statement that the patient has "No Known Allergies" then no coded structure is sent and the section is sent with a text string within the narrative. When the text string is derived from coded data it must match the text of the code: for example 716186003 "No known allergy"

##  Example Allergies and Adverse Reactions Sections ##

### Allergy to Penicillin ###

<script src="https://gist.github.com/IOPS-DEV/c02f9626ad71d2230cd51ded6d031bb2.js"></script>

### "No known allergy" ###

<script src="https://gist.github.com/IOPS-DEV/3f77d2ebcfcdf305a640484fb445cc1a.js"></script>

## Coded Resources ##

This text section should be linked to the following FHIR Resources to provide the textual information in a coded format.

- List
